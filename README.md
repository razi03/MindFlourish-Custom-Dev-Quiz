## Key Technologies

- **React + TypeScript**: Frontend UI and logic
- **React Router**: Client-side routing and navigation between quiz steps
- **Context API**: Global state management for quiz answers
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server

---

## Application Flow

1. **User Entry & Onboarding**  
   The user starts the quiz and is guided through a series of pages collecting personal information, preferences, and anxiety-related data.

2. **Quiz Steps**  
   - **Demographics & Preferences**: Gender (`QuizGender.tsx`), Age (`QuizAge.tsx`), Email (`QuizEmailPreference.tsx`), Phone (`QuizPhoneNumber.tsx`)  
   - **Anxiety Assessment**: Multiple question pages (`QuizQuestion4.tsx` through `QuizQuestion24.tsx`) gather detailed anxiety profile data.  
   - **Analysis & Stats**: Pages like `QuizAnxietyStats.tsx`, `QuizAnxietyProfile.tsx`, and `QuizAnxietyGlobalStats.tsx` analyze and present user data.  
   - **Plan Building**: `QuizCalmResetPlanBuilder.tsx` and `QuizPlan.tsx` generate a personalized calming plan based on answers.  
   - **Completion**: `QuizPlanCompletion.tsx` confirms completion and next steps.

3. **Navigation**  
   Navigation is handled via React Router, with each page representing a route. The `Header` component provides back navigation where appropriate.

4. **State Management**  
   User answers are stored in a global context (`QuizAnswersContext`) and updated as the user progresses.

## 🛠️ Code Architecture & Flow

### 1. **Routing & Page Navigation**

- The app uses **React Router** (see `App.tsx`) to define all quiz steps as routes.
- Each quiz step (e.g., `QuizGender.tsx`, `QuizAge.tsx`, `QuizEmailPreference.tsx`, etc.) is a separate page component under `src/pages/`.
  ```
- **Navigation** between pages is handled using the `useNavigate` hook from React Router. 

### 2. **Global State with Context**

- **QuizAnswersContext** (in `src/context/QuizAnswersContext.tsx`) holds all user answers and preferences.
- It provides:
  - `answers`: The current state of all quiz answers.
  - `setAnswer(key, value)`: A function to update a specific answer.
- **Usage in a page:**
  ```tsx
  import { useQuizAnswers } from "../context/QuizAnswersContext";
  // ...
  const { answers, setAnswer } = useQuizAnswers();
  // To update:
  setAnswer("gender", "female");
  ```
- This context is provided at the top level (likely in `main.tsx` or `App.tsx`), so all pages/components can access and update quiz answers.

### 3. **Data Flow Example**

1. **User lands on `/quiz/gender`**  
   - Chooses a gender.
   - `setAnswer("gender", value)` is called.
   - Navigates to `/quiz/age`.

2. **User lands on `/quiz/age`**  
   - Chooses an age.
   - `setAnswer("age", value)` is called.
   - Navigates to next step.

3. **This pattern continues through all quiz steps.**  
   - Each page collects a piece of data and saves it to context.
   - Navigation is always handled via `navigate("/next-step")`.

4. **Summary/Results Pages**  
   - Pages like `QuizAnxietyProfile.tsx`, `QuizPlan.tsx` read all answers from context and display analysis or a personalized plan.

### 4. **Reusable Components**

- Common UI elements (buttons, headers, cards, progress bars, etc.) are in `src/components/`.
- Example: The `Header` component is imported and used at the top of most pages for consistent navigation/back button.

### 5. **Styling**

- **Tailwind CSS** is used throughout for utility-first styling.
- Custom colors and fonts are set in the Tailwind config.
- Example of a styled button:
  ```tsx
  
    Continue
  
  ```

### 6. **Error Handling & Validation**

- Each input page (email, phone, etc.) includes validation logic.
- Errors are shown inline using conditional rendering and Tailwind classes.

### 7. **Page Completion & Plan Generation**

- After the last quiz question, the app navigates to analysis and plan pages.
- These pages use the full `answers` object from context to generate and display the personalized plan.

## Context & State Management

- **QuizAnswersContext**  
  Located in `src/context/QuizAnswersContext.tsx`, this context stores all user answers and preferences.  
  - Methods like `setAnswer` allow pages to update answers.  
  - The context ensures data persistence across pages and enables analysis components to access user data.

---

## Pages & Components

### Important Pages (`src/pages/`)

- `QuizGender.tsx`: Collects gender information.
- `QuizAge.tsx`: Collects age.
- `QuizEmailPreference.tsx`: Collects email for plan delivery.
- `QuizPhoneNumber.tsx`: Optional phone number for SMS.
- `QuizQuestionX.tsx`: Series of quiz questions (X = 4 to 24).
- `QuizAnxietyProfile.tsx`: Displays personalized anxiety profile.
- `QuizCalmResetPlanBuilder.tsx`: Builds personalized calming plan.
- `QuizPlan.tsx`: Shows the generated plan.
- `QuizPlanCompletion.tsx`: Final confirmation page.
- `NotFound.tsx`: 404 page for unmatched routes.

### Key Components (`src/components/`)

- `Header.tsx`: Top navigation bar with optional back button.
- Various UI components for buttons, cards, progress bars, etc.

---

## Styling & Assets

- **Tailwind CSS** is used extensively for layout, typography, colors, and responsive design.
- Custom colors like `flourishmint`, `flourishgreen`, and `flourishwhite` are defined in Tailwind config.
- Images and icons are stored within `src/assets` or imported directly in components.

## Summary

This project is a multi-step React quiz app that collects user data, analyzes anxiety profiles, and generates personalized calming plans. It uses React Router for navigation, Context API for state, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The code is modular with clear separation between pages, components, and context, allowing easy extension and maintenance.

**How pages are connected:**  
All pages are connected via React Router routes and the `useNavigate` hook. State is shared and persisted using the Context API. Each page collects a piece of user data, updates the global context, and navigates to the next step, ensuring a smooth, linear quiz flow. Final analysis and plan pages aggregate all collected answers for a personalized experience.
